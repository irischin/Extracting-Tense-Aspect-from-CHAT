# Extracting-Tense-Aspect-from-CHAT

This is a quick script I wrote for my [Tense/Aspect project](http://www.lingref.com/bucld/40/BUCLD40-05.pdf) that extracted progressive and perfective/past utterances from mother-child spontaneous speech samples transcribed in [CHAT (Codes for the Human Analysis of Transcripts)](http://childes.talkbank.org/). Using regex, it pulled out the relevant utterances as well information on the speaker (e.g., mother or child), the apsect/tense marker that was used (e.g. progressive), the verb that was marked (e.g., *build*), as well the morphological information of the utterance. Additionally, because we had different caregiver-child pairs that were sampled across multiple visits, the script also included information on which caregiver-child pair produced the particular speech sample and from which visit it was collected. These pieces of information were subsequently assembled into a data frame and exported as a tab-delimited text file for additional analysis.
